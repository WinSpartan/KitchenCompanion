# KitchenCompanion
For time well spent in the kitchen

This CRD (not a typo - no update capability in v.1 of this repo) web app uses the Python Flask Framework in conjunction with a SQLITE3 database for the backend.

The Front-End of this site uses the Halfmoon Framework: https://github.com/halfmoonui/halfmoon

It requires the recipe-scrapers library that allows it to scrape recipes from dozens of top sites.  See the full list and details on GitHub here:
